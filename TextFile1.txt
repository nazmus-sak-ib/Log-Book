Project Description: 
Had the first meeting on 14 August. 
Have to create a logbook for the students. They will "log" their days of activities, to be converted to 
summaries later

Things to add:
1. Log in/Sign up screen (with option to either prompt "renew" or "initial")
	- In that case, a separate file (file A) have to contain unique username-password combos
	- One file (file B) each for an account 
		- 2 possible variants ---> BR for renewal and BI for initial
		- Data content ----> date, activities

2. Logbook screen 1 (main)
	- viewports (VP) ----> a) Calendar b) sets of dropdowns for activities c) All activities done in a day
	- Selection of VPa changes VPb and VPc. VPb adds data into VPc. From VPc, data can be removed.

3. Logbook screen 2 (Activity wise summary)
	- (All dates listed && scores) OR table view
	- 


Data Sources and Types:
1. Renewal data read from a text file
2.
